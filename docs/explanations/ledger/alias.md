# Alias Transactions

Stardust introduces a new output type called [_Alias Output_](https://github.com/lzpap/tips/blob/master/tips/TIP-0018/tip-0018.md#alias-output) that is essentially a UTXO state machine. Simply put, this
represents a new type of ledger account suitable for committee ran smart contract chains. The main features are:

- storage of state commitments of the second-layer smart contract chains,
- globally unique address assigned upon creation,
- different account privileges for two controllers that can be rotated, and
- ability of issuing custom tokens that are linked to the unique address.

Alias outputs can be created by anyone in the protocol via transactions. A newly created alias receives a unique
identifier, called _Alias ID_, generated by the protocol based on the content of the creating transaction. Once an alias
output is created, only its controllers are able to unlock it in subsequent transactions.

Depending on which controller unlocks it, different commands or state mutations are possible. The _State Controller_ is
allowed to change the state data stored in the output and also to manipulate token balances of the alias account. One
restriction of the _State Controller_ is that whenever it unlocks the alias output in a transactions, it must transition
the alias into its new state, meaning the alias output must appear in the transaction as a created output.

The _Governor_ on the other hand might choose to destroy the alias by not creating its subsequent state as an output in
the transaction. It also has the power to change the controller entities.

Funds can be sent directly to the unique alias address (derived from _Alias ID_) of the alias by anyone. Since this
address is generated by the protocol, it doesn't have a private key that could be used for signing transactions to prove
ownership. So how does one prove that they own the funds locked under an alias address?

The trick is to require the unlocking of the alias output that defines the address in the same transaction that tries
to unlock funds sitting on the alias address. _If you can prove you own the alias account by successfully unlocking its
alias output in a transaction, you can access the funds locked under its address._

## Creating an Alias

Just like a regular _Basic Output_, an _Alias Output_ also has:
 - _Amount_ to hold base token
 - _Unlock Conditions_ that define how the output can be unlocked
 - _Features_ that don't modify the unlocking.

On top of these, it also defines:
 - _State Index_ that has to be incremented in every transaction initiated by the _State Controller_.
 - _State Metadata_ that may hold binary data,
 - _Foundry Counter_ that defines how many foundries the alias has already created,
 - _Immutable Features_ that are regular _Features_ defined upon creation which can never be modified afterwards.

Alias outputs only support two type of unlock conditions:
 - _State Controller Address Unlock Condition_ that defines the state controller,  and
 - _Governor Address Unlock Condition_ that defines the governor of the alias.

Transaction A shows the process of creating a new alias output and hence an alias account. Notice the creation
constraints enforced by the protocol:
 - _Alias ID_ must be zeroed out. This signals to the protocol that the alias account is new and when the transaction confirms,
   a unique _Alias ID_ must be generated.
 - _State Index_ must be zero as this is the first possible state the alias represents.
 - _Foundry Counter_ must be zero as the alias doesn't control any foundries yet.
 - _Issuer_ and _Sender_ addresses must be unlocked in the transaction if present.

When _Alias Output #1_ from Transaction A is consumed in a subsequent transaction, the _Alias ID_ field in the
transitioned alias must be set to the protocol generated unique identifier, which is the Blake2b-256 hash of the
_Output ID_ of _Alias Output #1_.

## State Transition

Transaction B represents a state transition of the alias. As the name suggests, a state transition must be initiated
by the _State Controller_, therefore it is the _stateControllerAddress_ that needs to sign the transaction. During a
state transition, the following constraints need to be met:
 - the alias can't be destroyed,
 - token balances of the output may be changed, the _State Controller_ can transfer funds in- and out of the alias account,
 - _State Index_ must be incremented,
 - _State Metadata_ may be updated,
 - _Foundry Counter_ must be incremented by the number of foundries created in the transaction,
 - _Unlock Conditions_ must not be changed, therefore the state controller can't update ownership of the alias account,
 - _Sender Feature_ may be updated,
 - _Metadata Feature_ must not be updated.

Notice how the _Alias ID_ field has to be set in _Alias Output #2_ to the protocol generated value.

## Governance Transition

Transaction C depicts a governance transition of the alias. Such a transaction must be signed by the address in
_Governor Address Unlock Condition_. The constraints for a valid governance transition are:
 - the alias output might be destroyed by the governor (Transaction D),
 - _State Controller Address Unlock Condition_ may be changed,
 - _Governor Address Unlock Condition_ may be changed,
 - _Metadata Feature_ may be changed.

No other fields are allowed to change in the next alias state, therefore a governance transition can't modify token
balances or create foundries.

## Destroying an Alias

Transaction D shows a governance transition that destroys the alias. The storage deposit is refunded to a governor
defined address. Keep in mind that once the alias is destroyed, any funds locked in the ledger in other outputs to the
address of the alias (derived from _Alias ID_) are essentially lost, as it is not possible to unlock them ever.

## Unlocking funds owned by an Alias

An alias account may own funds in the ledger two ways:
 - locked directly in its alias output,
 - locked in other outputs to the address of the alias.

The global alias address is derived from the unique _Alias ID_. Technically, the alias address is the concatenation of
the _Alias Address Type_ and the _Alias ID_. A practical example from [TIP-31](https://github.com/iotaledger/tips/blob/add-smr-hrps/tips/TIP-0031/tip-0031.md):
 - _Output ID_ (34-byte) that created the alias: `52fdfc072182654f163f5f0f9a621d729566c74d10037c4d7bbb0407d1e2c6490000`
 - _Alias ID_, BLAKE2b-256 hash (32-byte): `fe80c2eb7c736da2f7c98ecf135ee9e34e4e076afe6e1dfebc9ec578b8f56d2f`
 - Serialized alias address (33-byte): `08fe80c2eb7c736da2f7c98ecf135ee9e34e4e076afe6e1dfebc9ec578b8f56d2f`
 - Bech32 string:
    - IOTA (64-char): `iota1prlgpsht03ekmghhex8v7y67a835uns8dtlxu807hj0v279c74kj76j6rev`
    - IOTA Testnet (64-char): `atoi1prlgpsht03ekmghhex8v7y67a835uns8dtlxu807hj0v279c74kj7autzrp`
    - Shimmer (63-char): `smr1prlgpsht03ekmghhex8v7y67a835uns8dtlxu807hj0v279c74kj7dzrr0a`
    - Shimmer Testnet (63-char): `rms1prlgpsht03ekmghhex8v7y67a835uns8dtlxu807hj0v279c74kj7e9ge5y`

Anyone can send funds in the ledger to the address of the alias, while only the current state controller is able to
unlock such funds by including the alias itself in the very same transaction. An alias address doesn't have
a private key for signing unlocks, therefore one has to prove that they can unlock the alias output that created the
alias address.

Transaction E shows the process of alias unlocking. _Basic Output #3_ holds funds that are locked to the address of the
alias. The state controller initiates a state transition and included the basic output in the same transaction.
The _Unlock_ for _Basic Output #3_ is an _Alias Unlock_ that references the _Unlock_ of the alias that defines _aliasAddress_.

Important to note, that an _Alias Unlock_ may only reference an unlock at a lower index within the transaction to
prevent circular unlocking without any signature. Due to this reason, it is possible to intentionally deadlock aliases
by locking them to each other's alias address. Clients should implement safety mechanisms to prevent accidental user errors.
