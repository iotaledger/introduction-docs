**Code Repository**: [https://github.com/iotaledger/firefly](https://github.com/iotaledger/firefly)

## Verify your Firefly Desktop Download

When you download Firefly Desktop, you should verify its authenticity to make sure that you downloaded the correct one from the IOTA Foundation GitHub repository. In this how-to guide, you learn how to verify various Firefly Desktop downloads.


You can verify the authenticity of the Firefly Desktop by checking its SHA256 hash and code signature. The instructions for both of these steps differ, depending on your operating system.

### Windows Operating System

#### Verify the SHA256 Hash

1. Open a command-line interface.

2. Create a SHA256 hash of the Firefly Desktop `.exe` file. Replace the path with the path to your Firefly `.exe` file.

```
certUtil -hashfile path\to\firefly-desktop-version.exe SHA256
```

For example, if the file is in the `C:\Users\yourname\Downloads` directory, do the following:

```
certUtil -hashfile C:\Users\yourname\Downloads\firefly-desktop-1.0.0.exe SHA256
```

3. Compare your SHA256 hash with the one in the [release notes](https://github.com/iotaledger/firefly/releases) and make sure that they match.

#### Verify the code signature

1. Right-click on `firefly-desktop-version.exe`.

2. Go to **Digital Signatures** > **Details** > **View Certificate**.

##### For Firefly 1.2.0 and earlier
1. In the Certification Path tab, make sure that the path matches the following information:

    - DigiCert.
    - DigiCert SHA2 Assured Code Signing CA.
    - IOTA Stiftung.

2. Make sure that the Certificate status reads "This certificate is OK.".


##### For Firefly 1.3.0 and later
1. In the Certification Path tab, make sure that the path matches the following information:

    - Sectigo (AAA).
    - Sectigo Public Code Signing Root R46.
    - Sectigo Public Code Signing CA R36.
    - IOTA Stiftung.

2. Make sure that the Certificate status reads, "This certificate is OK.".

### MacOS Operating System

#### Verify the SHA256 Hash

1. Open the Terminal (in `/Applications/Utilities/Terminal`).

2. Create a SHA256 hash of the Firefly Desktop `.dmg` file. Replace the path with the path to your Firefly `.dmg` file.

  ```bash
  shasum -a 256 /path/to/firefly-desktop-version.dmg
  ```

  For example, if the file is in `~/Downloads`, do the following:

  ```bash
  shasum -a 256 ~/Downloads/firefly-desktop-1.0.0.dmg
  ```

3. Compare your SHA256 hash with the one in the [release notes](https://github.com/iotaledger/firefly/releases) and make sure that they match.

#### Verify the code signature

##### Prerequisites

To follow these instructions you need the [Xcode Command Line Tools](https://www.ics.uci.edu/~pattis/common/handouts/macmingweclipse/allexperimental/macxcodecommandlinetools.html).

1. Open the Terminal (in `/Applications/Utilities/Terminal`).

2. Verify the `Firefly.app` file's signature. Replace the path with the path to your `Firefly.app` file. This command confirms whether the code binaries are actually signed, the signature is valid, all the sealed components are unaltered, and the signature passes some basic consistency checks.

    ```bash
    codesign -d -vv /path/to/Firefly.app
    ```
    
    For example, if the file is in the `/Applications` directory, do the following:
    
    ```bash
    codesign -d -vv /Applications/Firefly.app
    ```

3. Make sure that the following information matches the output of the command:

    ```bash
    Identifier=org.iota.firefly
    Authority=Developer ID Application: IOTA Stiftung (UG77RJKZHH)
    Authority=Developer ID Certification Authority
    Authority=Apple Root CA
    ```

4. Test the signature against system policies. Replace the path with the path to your `Firefly.app` file.

    ```bash
    spctl -a -vv path/to/Firefly.app
    ```

    For example, if the file is in the `/Applications` directory, do the following:
    
    ```bash
    spctl -a -vv /Applications/Firefly.app
    ```

5. Make sure that the following information matches the output of the command (assuming Firefly is in the `/Applications` directory):

    ```
    /Applications/Firefly.app: accepted
    source=Developer ID
    origin=Developer ID Application: IOTA Stiftung (UG77RJKZHH)
    ```
    
    
### Linux Operating System

#### Verify the SHA256 Hash

##### Prerequisites

You will need the `sha256sum` package, which is included with most Linux distributions.

1. Open the Terminal.

2. Create a SHA256 hash of the Firefly Desktop executable file. Replace the path with the path to your Firefly executable file.

  ```bash
  sha256sum path/to/firefly-desktop-version.AppImage
  ```

  For example, if the file is in `~/Downloads`, do the following:

  ```bash
  sha256sum ~/Downloads/firefly-desktop-1.0.0.AppImage
  ```

3. Compare your SHA256 hash with the one in the [release notes](https://github.com/iotaledger/firefly/releases) and make sure that they match.

#### Verify the code signature

1. Download the .asc file in the Assets section of the [release notes](https://github.com/iotaledger/firefly/releases).

2. Import the Firefly GPG key from keyserver.ubuntu.com.

    ```bash
    gpg --keyserver keyserver.ubuntu.com --recv 466385BD0B40D9550F93C04746A440CCE5664A64
    ```

3. Make sure that the following information matches the output of the command:

    ```bash
    gpg: key 46A440CCE5664A64: public key "IOTA Foundation (IOTA Foundation Identity) <contact@iota.org>"
    ```

4. Verify the signature.

    ```bash
    gpg --verify path/to/firefly-desktop-version.AppImage.asc path/to/firefly-desktop-version.AppImage
    ```
    
    For example, if the .asc and .AppImage files are both in `~/Downloads`, do the following:
    
    ```bash
    gpg --verify ~/Downloads/firefly-desktop-1.0.0.AppImage.asc ~/Downloads/firefly-desktop-1.0.0.AppImage
    ```

5. Make sure that the following information matches the output of the command:

    ```bash
    gpg: Good signature from "IOTA Foundation (IOTA Foundation Identity) <contact@iota.org>"
    ```
