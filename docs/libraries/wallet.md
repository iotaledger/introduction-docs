# IOTA Wallet Library

The wallet library is a stateful library for developers; essentially it's a programmable wallet. It is recommended you use this library if you are mainly using IOTA for token transfers. This library supports the handling and monitoring multiple account/addresses at the same time. Its stateful design allows a management of multiple accounts and addresses in an effective manner.

In addition to this, it also supports the [Stronghold.rs](https://github.com/iotaledger/stronghold.rs) enclave, incorporating the best security practices in one package:
